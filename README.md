**Controlled Vs Uncontrolled Components**

In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. Whereas in uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself.
Usage of Component State is a must for controlled components. Use of state is completely optional for uncontrolled components, but one must use Refs in it.
With controlled components, we can validate as the input is being changed but the same is not possible with uncontrolled components.
